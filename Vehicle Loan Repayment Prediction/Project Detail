Non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs) are facing a growing challenge of loan defaults, particularly in the vehicle loan category. To address this issue and maintain profitability, this project aims to leverage a comprehensive dataset of client information to develop a predictive model for vehicle loan repayment.

**Problem Statement**

The NBFI in question is experiencing increased financial strain due to a rise in vehicle loan defaults. By analyzing various client attributes, such as income, credit history, employment details, and demographic information, the company seeks to create a model that accurately predicts whether a client is likely to default on their loan.

**Project Objectives**

> Loan Repayment Prediction: Construct a predictive model using machine learning techniques to classify clients into "likely to default" and "unlikely to default" categories based on their individual characteristics.

> Feature Importance Evaluation: Assess the relative importance of each variable in the dataset (e.g., income, credit score, employment duration) in determining loan repayment behavior.

> Model Optimization: Fine-tune the model's parameters and select the most effective algorithm for accurate prediction on the Test_Dataset.

> Actionable Recommendations: Deliver insights to the NBFI based on the model's findings, enabling them to tailor loan offerings, adjust interest rates, and implement risk mitigation strategies.

By successfully accomplishing these objectives, this project aims to empower the NBFI with a data-driven approach to manage vehicle loan defaults effectively, ultimately improving their financial performance and sustainability in the lending market.
