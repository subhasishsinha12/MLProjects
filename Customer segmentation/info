Problem Statement :
Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing customers into groups where the individuals are similar to each other in some ways.

This practice allows a business to create a group-specific campaign or digital advertisement.

It helps businesses to increase the effectiveness of the business's marketing and reducing the marketing costs to almost half.

It also enables businesses to focus marketing activities more on certain platforms based on the characteristics of the segments.

Though it is used to create homogenous groups of individuals, we will use it to understand consumer behavior in this notebook.

The aim of this problem is to segment the clients of a wholesale distributor based on their annual spending.

There are diverse product categories, like milk, grocery, region, etc..
