Project Description:
INLAB - Company inroduction

Our client for this project is a pharmaceutical company.

They have a long history of making effective drugs and are the leading producer of antibiotics for bacterial infection.

Their research and development team have recently developed five types of drugs to fight against chronic throat infection.

They want to quickly release the drug in the market so that they could cure people and increase revenue for the company.

Their R&D team made a brief analysis of the chemical composition present in the drug and made a brief report stating that each drug has a different effect according to their health.

The drug which has a higher concentration of chemicals should be given to those groups of people whose health report passes some criteria as suggested by the R&D team.

Current Scenario

The R&D group has invited some groups of people to test the drug, but going through each person’s health report might take a lot of time and cause a delay in launching the drug in the market.

The current process suffers from the following problems:

Testing phase takes a lot of time and it's done manually because they need to carefully examine each person for the side effects.

Most of the crucial time is being wasted in checking each person’s health report and dispensing specific drugs according to the health metric as suggested by the R&D team.

This process is time-consuming and wastage of resources.

The company has hired us as data science consultants.

They want us automate the process of assigning the drug according to their health report.
