Introduction:
In the dynamic world of retail banking, the introduction of value-added services is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage and customer satisfaction. One such service that has gained prominence is stock trading facilities, offering customers an avenue to invest and grow their wealth directly through their trusted banking partner.Our client, a well-established retail banking institution, has recognized this opportunity and launched a stock trading facility for their existing customers. This strategic move is not only an expansion of their service portfolio but also a step towards deepening customer relationships and enhancing revenue streams. The banking sector's inherent trust and substantial customer base provide a fertile ground for such cross-selling initiatives.

However, with every new venture comes its unique challenges and the need for strategic customer segmentation to maximize return on investment. The client's initiative now is to refine their approach by understanding and categorizing their customer base more effectively.

Problem Statement:
The core challenge lies in accurately identifying and classifying customers into two distinct groups: high net worth and low net worth individuals. This classification is crucial as it directly impacts the bank's strategy in incentivizing customer participation in the stock trading facility.

Currently, the bank faces a specific issue: only about 10% of their customers engage in trading activities sufficiently enough to make the earnings, after factoring in discounts, profitable for the bank. The goal is to pinpoint these high-engagement customers to tailor the bank's marketing and incentive strategies more effectively.

The task at hand is to develop a robust classification model using historical customer data. This model aims to predict whether a future customer belongs to a high net worth or low net worth group based on various attributes like occupation, income, investment behavior, and more. The bank intends to use these insights to craft targeted strategies that will encourage trading activity among the most promising customer segments, thus optimizing resource allocation and maximizing the profitability of this new service offering.
